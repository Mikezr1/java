Hint: try read a bit about ‘recursion’

The Council of Freach has summoned you. New writing has appeared on the Tomb of Algol the Wise, the
last True Programmer to wander this land. The writing strikes fear and awe into the hearts of the looploving people of Freach:
“The next True Programmer shall be able to write any looping code with a
method call instead.” The Senior Counselor, scared of a world without loops, asks you to put your skill to
the test and rewrite the following code, which counts down from 10 to 1, with no loops:

        for (int x = 10; x > 0; x--)
        System.out.println(x);
To study if you find this difficult yet:
Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.
Recursion may be a bit difficult to understand. The best way to figure out how it works is to experiment with it.
